<h1>Hotel & Spa Website Project</h1>
Welcome to the Hotel & Spa Website Project repository! This project aims to develop a comprehensive, user-friendly website for a hotel and spa, utilizing modern web development tools and methodologies. The project is managed using agile methodologies to ensure flexibility and continuous improvement.
<h2>Project Overview</h2>
The Hotel & Spa website will provide users with information about the hotel's amenities, spa services, room availability, pricing, and an easy-to-use booking system. The goal is to create an attractive and functional website that enhances user experience and drives bookings.
<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>

HTML5: For structuring the content of the website.

CSS3: For styling and layout design.

JavaScript: For interactive elements and functionality.

Figma: For designing the website layout and user interface.

Trello: For project management and task tracking.

Agile Methodologies: For iterative development and continuous improvement.

Teamwork: For collaboration and communication among team members.

<h2>Agile Workflow</h2>
    <p>We follow agile methodologies to manage the project efficiently. The workflow includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sprint Planning</strong>: Defining goals and tasks for each sprint.</li>
        <li><strong>Daily Standups</strong>: Brief meetings to discuss progress and obstacles.</li>
        <li><strong>Sprint Review</strong>: Demonstrating the work completed at the end of each sprint.</li>
        <li><strong>Sprint Retrospective</strong>: Reflecting on the process and identifying areas for improvement.</li>
    </ul>
    
<h3>Trello Board</h3>
<p>We use Trello for task management and tracking. Trello allows us to create boards for different aspects of the project, where we can add lists for tasks, progress stages, and backlog items. Each task is represented by a card that can be moved across lists as it progresses through different stages of development. The benefits of using Trello include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Visual Organization</strong>: Easy-to-use visual boards help in organizing tasks and monitoring progress.</li>
        <li><strong>Collaboration</strong>: Team members can collaborate in real-time, comment on tasks, and share attachments.</li>
        <li><strong>Flexibility</strong>: Customizable boards and lists to fit the specific needs of the project.</li>
        <li><strong>Integration</strong>: Seamless integration with other tools such as Slack, Google Drive, and more.</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Design</h2>
    <p>The website design is created in Figma, ensuring a visually appealing and user-friendly interface. Figma's developer mode is particularly useful as it provides detailed specifications, CSS code snippets, and assets export directly from the design files, streamlining the handoff process between designers and developers. This step is crucial as it facilitates clear communication with clients about design choices and functionality, ensuring their vision is accurately translated into the final product. The design files are available in the <code>Style</code> directory.</p>
   
<h2>Collaboration</h2>
<p>Effective teamwork is crucial for the success of this project. We use various tools and practices to enhance collaboration:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Regular Meetings</strong>: Scheduled to discuss progress, challenges, and next steps.</li>
    <li><strong>Code Reviews</strong>: Ensuring code quality and knowledge sharing.</li>
    <li><strong>Communication</strong>: Using tools like Slack for instant messaging and file sharing.</li>
</ul>
